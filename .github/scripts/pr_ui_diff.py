"""Before/after Studio evidence for a PR, from two isolated installs.

    python pr_ui_diff.py --pr 8222                    # a registered PR
    python pr_ui_diff.py --pr 8222 --skip-install     # reuse the homes

A PR nobody has registered needs no edit to registry.py to be shot. Name a scene
and what the shot must show, and check it costs nothing first:

    python pr_ui_diff.py --pr 9101 --scene gguf_picker_rows \
        --expect "4 rows -> 18 rows, each at its own true size" \
        --scene-kwargs '{"repo": "org/Model-GGUF"}' --preflight

`--preflight` resolves the PR, imports the scene and stops before building, so a
typo costs seconds rather than two installs. Drop it to shoot. Register the plan
once it works: `verified` is where what was actually observed gets written down.

Installs Studio twice under two distinct UNSLOTH_STUDIO_HOMEs -- one at the PR's
MERGE BASE, one at its head -- drives the same scene against both, and composes a
labelled BEFORE/AFTER image.

Two design points, both load-bearing:

* Two full installs, not one Studio with a `git checkout` between shots.
  `install.sh --local` builds the frontend from the checked-out tree, so a UI
  change only exists in a build made from that tree. Swapping branches under a
  running Studio serves the old bundle and yields two identical screenshots --
  which looks exactly like a successful comparison of a PR that changed nothing.

* BEFORE is the PR's merge base, not current main. `main` moves several times a
  day here; photographing against it shows the PR's change plus everything else
  that landed in between, and credits the lot to the PR.

The scene, its parameters and the difference it is expected to show all live in
`pr_ui_scenes/registry.py`. Read the plan's `expect` before believing any pair.
