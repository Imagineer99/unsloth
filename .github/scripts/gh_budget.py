gh_budget.py -- one host-wide, cross-user admission controller for `gh` reads.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT gh_read_env.py
-------------------------------------------------
gh_read_env.py rations the PRIMARY budget per token. Two measured facts made
that insufficient:

1. Its sensor is dead. `gh api rate_limit` returns remaining=5000, used=0 for
   every token we hold, while the x-ratelimit headers on a REAL request to the
   same resource report the truth. Observed 2026-09-15, same second, same
   token:

       gh api rate_limit          -> remaining=5000  used=0
       gh api -i repos/<o>/<r>    -> remaining=4280  used=720

   So RESERVE_FRACTION, the TOKEN_ORDER spend-down and block-until-reset never
   engaged: by the only number the pool could see, nothing was ever wrong.
   Note the /rate_limit endpoint reports a bucket of its own -- its own
   response headers also say used=0 -- so it cannot be calibrated against
   itself. Only a request to a real resource tells the truth.

2. Its throttle is per-PROCESS. `_gh_sem` and `_throttle()` are module globals,
   so they cap one Python process. The deployment is ~40 concurrent launches
   spread over four unix users (daniel1, daniel2, daniel3, ubuntu), and
   GitHub's limits are per USER, not per token or per process. Four users at
   "concurrency 3" is concurrency 12 as far as GitHub is concerned.

This module holds the part that must be shared by every process on the host: a
cap on concurrent requests, a host-wide rate floor, a usage ledger fed from real
response headers, and a cooldown that one process can trip on behalf of all of
them. It costs the sessions nothing real -- they still do all their local and
model work concurrently, and only the GitHub calls queue. Measured with
scripts/bench_gh_budget.py at the defaults below: 40 sessions making 8 requests
each finish in ~54s wall, the unluckiest waiting ~54s, at ~5.9 req/s. Confirmed
against live GitHub with 320 genuine requests: zero secondary-limit rejections.

CROSS-USER FILESYSTEM CONSTRAINTS (verified on this host, do not "simplify")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* /mnt/disks/unslothai/daniel{1,2,3} and .../ubuntu are 0700. The four users
  genuinely cannot read each other's trees, which is why none of the existing
  state (~/.claude/summary-db, the account pools) can be reused here. The
  shared directory has to live outside all of them.
* It must be setgid with a group all four users share (2775, group `users`),
  NOT sticky. In a sticky (1777) directory you cannot rename over or unlink a
  file owned by another user, which breaks any replace-based write.
* setgid propagates the PARENT's group. If the parent is owned by one user's
  private group, the auto-created child inherits it and silently locks out
  everyone else. state_dir() warns when it ends up on the fallback path for
  exactly this reason.
* The ledger is ONE long-lived file mutated in place under flock. Do not
  os.replace() it and do not delete it to "reset": the atomic_write pattern in
  account_pool.py:204 is correct for a private dir and wrong here.
* Files are created 0666 via os.open(..., 0o666) + fchmod, because the caller's
  umask would otherwise strip group/other write and lock out the next user.
  This is also what lets a file created before the group was fixed keep
  working.

CLI:
    python3 gh_budget.py status        # show the shared ledger
    python3 gh_budget.py calibrate     # force a real header reading (1 call)

#   300/min, against a documented REST limit of 900 points/min.
#

#   no global cap and no spacing at all.

# ten times more conservative than the documented ceiling, and slow enough to
